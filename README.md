# Yulu-Project
# Project Description

This project aims to analyze YULU bike that Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market and how well those variables describe the electric cycle demands.

The approach involves extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, followed by hypothesis testing using ANOVA, sample t-tests, and chi-square tests to determine the statistical significance of observed differences in demands. The results will provide data-driven insights into the effectiveness of YULUâ€™s demand strategies.
